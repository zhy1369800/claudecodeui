  <h1>Cloud CLI (aka Claude Code UI)</h1>
</div>


A desktop and mobile UI for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor CLI](https://docs.cursor.com/en/cli/overview), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), and [Gemini-CLI](https://geminicli.com/). You can use it locally or remotely to view your active projects and sessions and make changes to them from everywhere (mobile or desktop). This gives you a proper interface that works everywhere.

## Quick Start

### CloudCLI Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started — no local setup required. Get a fully managed, containerized development environment accessible from the web, mobile app, API, or your favorite IDE.

**[Get started with CloudCLI Cloud](https://cloudcli.ai)**


### Self-Hosted (Open source)

Try CloudCLI UI instantly with **npx** (requires **Node.js** v22+):

```
npx @siteboon/claude-code-ui
```

Or install **globally** for regular use:

```
npm install -g @siteboon/claude-code-ui
cloudcli
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` — all your existing sessions are discovered automatically.

Visit the **[documentation →](https://cloudcli.ai/docs)** for more full configuration options, PM2, remote server setup and more

## Which option is right for you?

CloudCLI UI is the open source UI layer that powers CloudCLI Cloud. You can self-host it on your own machine, or use CloudCLI Cloud which builds on top of it with a full managed cloud environment, team features, and deeper integrations.

| | CloudCLI UI (Self-hosted) | CloudCLI Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Developers who want a full UI for local agent sessions on their own machine | Teams and developers who want agents running in the cloud, accessible from anywhere |
| **How you access it** | Browser via `[yourip]:port` | Browser, any IDE, REST API, n8n |
| **Setup** | `npx @siteboon/claude-code-ui` | No setup required |
| **Machine needs to stay on** | Yes | No |
| **Mobile access** | Any browser on your network | Any device, native app coming |
| **Sessions available** | All sessions auto-discovered from `~/.claude` | All sessions within your cloud environment |
| **Agents supported** | Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex, Gemini CLI | Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex, Gemini CLI |
| **File explorer and Git** | Yes, built into the UI | Yes, built into the UI |
| **MCP configuration** | Managed via UI, synced with your local `~/.claude` config | Managed via UI |
| **IDE access** | Your local IDE | Any IDE connected to your cloud environment |
| **REST API** | Yes | Yes |
| **n8n node** | No | Yes |
| **Team sharing** | No | Yes |
| **Platform cost** | Free, open source | Starts at $7/month |

> Both options use your own AI subscriptions (Claude, Cursor, etc.) — CloudCLI provides the environment, not the AI.

## Security & Tools Configuration

**🔒 Important Notice**: All Claude Code tools are **disabled by default**. This prevents potentially harmful operations from running automatically.

### Enabling Tools

To use Claude Code's full functionality, you'll need to manually enable tools:

1. **Open Tools Settings** - Click the gear icon in the sidebar
3. **Enable Selectively** - Turn on only the tools you need
4. **Apply Settings** - Your preferences are saved locally

<div align="center">

![Tools Settings Modal](public/screenshots/tools-modal.png)
*Tools Settings interface - enable only what you need*

</div>

**Recommended approach**: Start with basic tools enabled and add more as needed. You can always adjust these settings later.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How is this different from Claude Code Remote Control?</summary>

Claude Code Remote Control lets you send messages to a session already running in your local terminal. Your machine has to stay on, your terminal has to stay open, and sessions time out after roughly 10 minutes without a network connection.

CloudCLI UI and CloudCLI Cloud extend Claude Code rather than sit alongside it — your MCP servers, permissions, settings, and sessions are the exact same ones Claude Code uses natively. Nothing is duplicated or managed separately.

Here's what that means in practice:

- **All your sessions, not just one** — CloudCLI UI auto-discovers every session from your `~/.claude` folder. Remote Control only exposes the single active session to make it available in the Claude mobile app.
- **Your settings are your settings** — MCP servers, tool permissions, and project config you change in CloudCLI UI are written directly to your Claude Code config and take effect immediately, and vice versa.
- **Works with more agents** — Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex, and Gemini CLI, not just Claude Code.
- **Full UI, not just a chat window** — file explorer, Git integration, MCP management, and a shell terminal are all built in.
- **CloudCLI Cloud runs in the cloud** — close your laptop, the agent keeps running. No terminal to babysit, no machine to keep awake.

<details>
<summary>Do I need to pay for an AI subscription separately?</summary>

Yes. CloudCLI provides the environment, not the AI. You bring your own Claude, Cursor, Codex, or Gemini subscription. CloudCLI Cloud starts at $7/month for the hosted environment on top of that.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use CloudCLI UI on my phone?</summary>

Yes. For self-hosted, run the server on your machine and open `[yourip]:port` in any browser on your network. For CloudCLI Cloud, open it from any device — no VPN, no port forwarding, no setup. A native app is also in the works.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Will changes I make in the UI affect my local Claude Code setup?</summary>

Yes, for self-hosted. CloudCLI UI reads from and writes to the same `~/.claude` config that Claude Code uses natively. MCP servers you add via the UI show up in Claude Code immediately and vice versa.
